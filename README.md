this repo contains the review material for don frey's ipc 144 class.

Extra Review Class:

I will be doing a slightly longer scavenger hunt with my students during their lab time on Friday.
T2107, 12:35 to 2:25.

I will also host a small group review session in T3131 from 3:20pm to 5:00pm.

You are welcome to come to one or both (though you are not eligible for the scavenger hunt prize)

Practice questions:
